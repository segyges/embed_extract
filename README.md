### Embedding extractor

This is for extracting just the embedding layer for a series of Pythia models.

To get all embeddings for a given Pythia model, you need to

1) Set the model name correctly in todo_maker.py and run it. (Commited as EleutherAI/pythia-14m)
2) Create an empty file done.txt
3) Run embed_extract.py
